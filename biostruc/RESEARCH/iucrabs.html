<a href="http://www4.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/">Entrez</a> is an Internet tool for retrieval 
of information on the structure and function of biological macromolecules 
[<A HREF="#Ref_1">1</A>,<A HREF="#Ref_2">2</A>] (http://www4.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/). It provides 
daily-updated databases of molecular sequences, three-dimensional structures, and the Medline 
citations pertaining to molecular genetics. With simple term matching queries one 
may easily retrieve information on a molecule of interest from any of these sources. One 
may also easily "link" between databases, to retrieve, for example, the Medline citations 
contained within a molecular sequence or structure report.<p>
<br>
Entrez's most powerful source of information on molecular structure and function, however, 
is provided by its "neighbor" database. The neighbors of a sequence are its 
homologs, as identified by a significant similarity score using the 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">BLAST</a> algorithm[<A HREF="#Ref_3">3</A>]. The 
neighbors of a Medline citation are articles which use surprisingly similar terms in their title 
and abstract[<A HREF="#Ref_4">4</A>]. Since biological functions are often conserved among members of a 
homology group, and/or described in the associated Medline abstracts, one may easily 
explore the structure-function relationships of an entire protein family by traversing these 
neighbor relationships.<p>
<br>
Structural neighbor information in Entrez is based on a direct comparison of 3D structure. 
All of the roughly 10,000 domain substructures within the current Protein Data Bank[<A HREF="#Ref_5">5</A>] 
have been compared to one another using the 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/VAST/vast.html">VAST</a> 
algorithm[<A HREF="#Ref_6">6</A>,<A HREF="#Ref_7">7</A>], and the structure-
structure alignments and superpositions recorded. The VAST algorithm, for 
"Vector Alignment Search Tool", places great emphasis on the definition of the threshold of significant 
structural similarity. By focusing on similarities that are surprising in the statistical sense, 
one does not waste time examining many similarities of small substructures that occur by 
chance in protein structure comparison. Very many of the remaining similarities are examples 
of remote homology, often undetectable by sequence comparison. As such they may 
provide a broader view of the structure, function and evolution of a protein family.<p>
<br>
At the heart of VAST's significance calculation is definition of the "unit" of tertiary structure 
similarity as pairs of secondary structure elements (SSE's) that have similar type, relative 
orientation, and connectivity. In comparing two protein domains the most surprising substructure similarity is that where the sum of superposition scores across these "units" is 
greatest. The likelihood that this similarity would be seen by chance is then given as a simple 
product: the probability that one would obtain this score in drawing so many "units" at 
random, times the number of alternative SSE-pair combinations possible in the domain 
comparison, from which one has chosen the best. In practice one finds that the VAST 
significance threshold identifies similarities that span a sizable fraction of the structures 
compared, and it would appear that this theory corresponds to the subjective criteria long 
employed by crystallographers.<p>
<br>
In addition to a listing of similar structures, neighbors within the Entrez 3D structure 
database contain detailed residue-by-residue alignments and transformation matrices for 
structural superposition. Alternative alignments are examined using a Gibbs sampling 
algorithm, beginning from the "seed" SSE-pair alignment. The optimal alignment is 
defined as that which is most surprising relative to the background distribution of 
alpha-carbon superposition residuals one obtains by chance drawing structural fragments at 
random. This definition provides an objective criterion with which to balance the 
well-known trade-off of lower superposition residuals versus more aligned residues. In practice 
refined alignments from VAST appear conservative, choosing a highly similar "core" 
substructure. In this superposition one easily identifies regions where protein evolution has 
modified the structure.<p>
<br>
Structural neighbor calculations for Entrez are based on the 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/MMDB/struchelp.html">MMDB</a> database
[<A HREF="#Ref_2">2</A>,
<A HREF="#Ref_8">8</A>] (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/">http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/</a>), a validated version of the Protein Data Bank in a 
computer-friendly form suitable for comparative analysis. Structural neighbors are presented 
via 3D molecular graphic images, using the 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3d.html">Cn3D</a> viewer that is distributed as part of the 
Entrez client software. Cn3D operates on a variety of computer platforms, including 
MacIntosh, Windows and Unix, and it provides a variety of algorithmic rendering schemes 
suitable for visualization of structural superpositions. Structure superposition data may 
also be easily exported from Entrez, most simply by writing PDB-format files rotated to the 
reference frame of a neighbor. In this way Entrez may serve as a starting point for detailed 
comparative analysis by structural biologists using other software to examine the patterns 
of structural conservation and change within a protein family.<p>
