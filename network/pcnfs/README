In order to use the NCBI network services in conjunction with the PC-NFS 4.0
development tools, it is necessary to copy and create the following directories
into this directory after you have installed PC-NFS development software
version 4.0a:

include (including all its associated subdirectories)
borlib
msclib

These files are copyrighted by Sun Microsystems, so it is not possible for
NCBI to distribute them in its software tree.

Note that you may, e.g., refrain from copying the msclib directory if
you are only using the Borland compiler, and conversely.

Note that applications developed in this environment must (according to
the PC-NFS documentation) only be run with PC-NFS version 4.0 or 4.0a.

Note that for PC-NFS version 5.0 and up, you should ignore this
directory and instead use the instructions which appear in the winsock
directory of this source tree, since PC-NFS 5.0 is WinSock-compliant.
