In order to use the NCBI-modified NCSA socket library, and NCBI network
services on a Macintosh, it is necessary to obtain the following files
from the MacTCP developer disk, and place them within this "apple"
directory.

dnr.c
AddressXlation.h
GetMyIPAddr.h
MacTCPCommonTypes.h
TCPPB.h
UDPPB.h

These files are copyrighted by Apple, so it is not possible for NCBI
to distribute them in its software tree.
