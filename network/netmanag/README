In order to use the NCBI network services in conjunction with the NetManage
Software development kit, it is necessary to copy the following files
from the NEWT-SDK developer disks into this "netmanag" directory.

nmpcip.h
nmpcip.lib

These files are copyrighted by NetManage, so it is not possible for NCBI
to distribute them in its software tree.
