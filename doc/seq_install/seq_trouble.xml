          If your browser will
          not download the Sequin program:<br />

            ftp</span><span class="c6">.</span> Many
            organizations allow only passive ftp transfers
            through their firewalls. If your browser does not
            download Sequin, be sure that your browser uses
            passive mode for ftp. See <a href=
            "seq_ftp_download.html#passivemode">Downloading
            with ftp</a> for instructions on how to configure
            your browser for passive mode.<br /></li>

            be down, or there may be other configuration
            problems with using ftp in your network. Tell your
            administrator that you're having trouble with
            downloads. Ask if you need to configure a proxy to
            use ftp, and if so, how to do it. Ask him or her to
            read this article and propose a solution:<br />
