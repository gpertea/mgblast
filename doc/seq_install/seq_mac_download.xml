    <h4 class="c6">System Requirements</h4>
    
    <p>
      The current version of
      Sequin works with the following Windows versions:
      
      <ul>
        <li>Macintosh OS 9</li>
        <li>OS X</li>
      </ul>
      
      It may work on other versions (MacOS &lt; 9), as
      well.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="c6">Downloading Sequin</h4>
    <p>
      We provide a single download for both MacOS and OS X
      platforms.
      <ol>
        <li class="c7">Create temporary installation folder on
        your hard drive where you will place the downloaded
        Sequin installation file.</li>
        <li class="c7">Download Sequin using your Web browser
        by clicking this link:<br />
        <a href=
           "ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/sequin/CURRENT/sequin.Mac.hqx">sequin.Mac.hqx</a>.
        </li>
        <li class="c7">Your Web browser may show a dialog box
        asking if you want to run the program, or save it to
        disk. Choose <span class="c1"><span class=
        "c8">S</span>ave to disk...</span> and save the file in
        the installation folder.</li>
        <li>If your Web browser can't download the file for
        some reason, see <a href=
        "seq_trouble.html">Troubleshooting</a>.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="c6">Installing Sequin</h4>
    
    <p>
      Follow these instructions to install Sequin on
      Macintosh:
      <ol>
        <li class="c7">The file should automatically extract
        into a new file called <span class=
        "c9">sequin.Mac.sea</span>. If it doesn't, use BinHex
        or UnStuff to convert it. Move the <span class=
        "c9">.sea</span> file to your installation folder if it
        isn't already there.</li>
        <li class="c7">Double-click the file <span class=
        "c9">sequin.Mac.sea</span>. (It is a self-extracting
        archive.) This will create a folder called Sequin
        Folder in your installation folder.</li>
        <li class="c7">Place the Sequin Folder in your
        Applications directory. This contains two versions of
        the Sequin, asn2gb, and tbl2asn applications (one with
        an "OSX" suffix and one without). It also contains the
        <span class="c9">sequin.htm</span> user's guide. The
        applications with the OSX suffix run only on Mac OS X.
        The other versions use Apple's "Carbon" library, and
        can run on both OS 9 or OS X.</li>
        <li class="c7">To run Sequin, double-click the
        <span class="c9">Sequin</span> file in MacOS 9, or the
        <span class="c9">SequinOSX</span> file in OS X.</li>
        <li class="c7">To run tbl2asn, double-click
        <span class="c9">tbl2asn</span> in MacOS 9, or
        <span class="c9">tbl2asnOSX</span> in OS X.</li>
      </ol>
