      <p> When first downloaded, your NCBI application runs in stand-alone mode, 
        without access to the network. However, your program can also be configured 
        to exchange information with the NCBI (GenBank) over the Internet. The 
        network-aware mode of your application is identical to the stand-alone 
        mode, but it contains some additional useful options. 
      <p> Your application can only function in its network-aware mode if the 
        computer on which it resides has a direct Internet connection. Electronic 
        mail access to the Internet is insufficient. In general, if you can install 
        and use a WWW-browser on your system, you should be able to install and 
        use the network. Check with your system administrator or Internet provider 
        if you are uncertain as to whether you have direct Internet connectivity. 
      <p> To launch the configuration form, select Net Configure under the Misc 
        menu in Sequin or Network Entrez, or the Options menu in Cn3D.  If you are using 
blastcl3, you must run Sequin, Network Entrez, or Cn3D first to configure blastcl3.  This is
necessary because blastcl3 has no graphical user interface.<br>

<p>
If you are not behind a firewall, set the <b>Connection</b> control to <b>Normal</b>.
If you also have a Domain Name Server (DNS) available, you can now simply press
<b>Accept</b>.

<p>
If DNS is not available, uncheck the <b>Domain Name Server</b> button. If you
are behind a firewall, set the <b>Connection</b> control to <b>Firewall</b>.
The <b>Proxy</b> box then becomes active. If you also use a proxy server,
type in its address. (If you have DNS, it will be of the form
<tt>www.myproxy.myuniversity.edu</tt>. If you do not have DNS, you should use
the numerical IP address of the form <tt>127.45.23.6</tt>.) Once you type something
in the <b>Proxy</b> box, the <b>Port</b> box and <b>Transparent Proxy</b> button
become active and can be filled in or changed as appropriate. (By default the
<b>Transparent Proxy</b> button is off, indicating a CERN-like proxy.) Ask your
network administrator for advice on the proper settings to use.

<p>
If you are in the United States, the default <b>Timeout</b> of 30 seconds should
suffice. From foreign countries with poor Internet connection to the U.S., you
can select up to 5 minutes as the timeout.

<p>
Finally, you will need to quit and restart your application in order for the network-aware
settings to take effect.

<p>
If you are behind a firewall, it must be configured correctly to access NCBI
services. Your network administrators may have done this already. If not, please
have them read the section below.

<p>
<a name="Settings"></a>
<b>The following section is intended for network administrators:</b>

<p>
Using NCBI services from behind a security firewall requires opening ports in
your firewall. The ports to open are:

<p align="center">
<pre>
Firewall Port        IP Address
--------------------------------
 5860..5870         130.14.29.112
    5845            130.14.22.12  (cannot be accessed from outside NCBI!)
</pre>

<p>
If your firewall is not transparent, the firewall port number
should be mapped to the same port number on the external host.

<p>
Port 5860 is usually not accessible by the public but reserved
for NCBI internal purposes only.  However, we recommend that it
is kept open just as all other ports in the range in case the
public access will be eventually enabled on this port.

<p>
To see what ports are currently on, and their status, as reported within
NCBI, please refer to the following <a href="fwd_check.cgi">Firewall
Daemon Presence Check</a> page.  Ports marked <b>INTERNAL</b> are
for NCBI use only and may be inaccessible from your site without,
however, affecting availability of any services that NCBI provides.

<p>
TROUBLESHOOTING:  You can test if these ports are accessible from
your host by just running, for example (see the "Ports to open" list
above):
<pre>
  telnet 130.14.29.112 5861
</pre>
and entering a line of arbitrary text in the telnet session.
If everything is fine, your TELNET session will look as follows
(the line "test" is your input here):

<pre>
| > telnet 130.14.29.112 5861
| Trying 130.14.29.112...
| Connected to 130.14.29.112.
| Escape character is '^]'.
| test
| NCBI Firewall Daemon:  Invalid ticket. Connection closed.
| Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>

<p>
There is also an auxiliary UNIX shell script
<a href="fwd_check.sh">fwd_check.sh</a> to check all of the above
addresses.

<p>
Note: Old NCBI clients used different application configuration settings and
ports than listed above. If you need to support such clients, which are now
obsolete, please contact <a href="mailto:info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">
<tt>info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</tt></a> for further information.
