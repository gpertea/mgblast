<h1>NCBI Dispatcher Parameters</h1>

<p>
There are two pieces of code in C toolkit that allow an application to contact
NCBI dispatchers, the new and the old one. The old dispatcher is being phased out
and is no longer supported at NCBI. All new services that are added get configured
with the new dispatcher. The code to access the new dispatcher had been placed
in the toolkit a while ago, and should be ready for use in all applications
compiled and linked against the toolkit released since beginning of 2002
[recent repository check showed that actually the cut-off date can perhaps be half
a year earlier, in early summer 2001].
Older applications have to be upgraded by re-compiling/re-linking in order
to take advantage of the new code.

<p>
In the beginning of August 2002, the switch was made in the toolkit's code that
now directs all network requests to go through the new dispatcher. So all
applications linked against the toolkit at a later date should be using
the new dispatcher automatically.

<p>
Below is the description of parameters and differences between the two dispatchers,
and instructions on how to set an existing application to use the new dispatcher's
code without rebuilding.

<p>
Although the dispatcher should work behind the scenes absolutely transparently
for the user, some applications may fail if for example there
are on-site configurational discrepancies between the two dispatchers.
In fact, every attempt was made to keep the configurations consistent
at the time of the switch, but still there is a little chance that
something could have been missed.

<p>
<hr>


<h2><a name="Switch">The switch</a></h2>

All <tt>SRV_...</tt> parameters, outlined below, can be set in either program
environment prior to the application run (using "<tt>setenv</tt>" command
in <tt>[t]csh</tt>, or "<tt>export</tt>" command in [ba]sh), or in the section
<tt>[NET_SERV]</tt> of the <tt>.rc</tt> (or <tt>.ini</tt>) file, also known as
a configuration (or registry) file of the application.<br>
<u>Note</u>: Settings in the environment always take precedence and override those read from the registry file.<br>
<u>Note</u>: On MS-Windows, the registry file usually resides in the master Windows directory, which is either
<tt>WINDOWS</tt> or <tt>WINNT</tt>.

<p>
A dispatcher to use can be controlled by the environment
variable <tt>SRV_CONN_MODE</tt> as follows:
<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr>
<td><tt>SRV_CONN_MODE=SERVICE</tt></td>
<td>chooses the new dispatcher [default for all programs built since mid August, 2002]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>SRV_CONN_MODE=WWW</tt></td>
<td>chooses the old dispatcher, without firewalling [this was the default prior to the switchover in mid August, 2002]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>SRV_CONN_MODE=FIREWALL</tt></td>
<td>chooses the old dispatcher, with firewalling</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>


<h2><a name="OldDispatcher">Parameters of the OLD dispatcher</a></h2>

The parameters, which control the OLD dispatcher (both with and without firewall), are in the table below.
Please note that they can appear both in the environment or in the registry file (section <tt>[NET_SERV]</tt>),
with those found in the environment taking the precedence.
<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1">
<tr>
<td><table border="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td><tt>SRV_ENGINE_HOST</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>SRV_ENGINE_PORT</tt></td></tr>
</table></td>
<td>host and port to locate dispatcher. Default&nbsp;=&nbsp;<tt>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80</tt>
(should normally not be changed)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>SRV_ENGINE_URL</tt></td>
<td>path part of URI to locate dispatcher. Default&nbsp;=&nbsp;<tt>/Service/nph-dispd.cgi</tt>
(should normally not be changed, either)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>SRV_CONN_TIMEOUT</tt></td>
<td>time (as a floating point value, seconds) to wait for network activity, at most. Default&nbsp;=&nbsp;30.
Special value <tt>INFINITE</tt> is also recognized to set the timeout value to "wait forever".<br>
<u>Note</u>: If you are in the United States, the default timeout of 30 seconds should
suffice. From foreign countries with poor Internet connections to the U.S., you may
want to increase this value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>SRV_CONN_TRY</tt></td>
<td>how many connection attempts to perform if unsuccessful, default&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><table border="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td><tt>SRV_HTTP_PROXY_HOST</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>SRV_HTTP_PROXY_PORT</tt></td></tr>
</table></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>SRV_PROXY_HOST</tt></td>
<td>CERN-like (non-transparent) proxy host (if in use at the client's end), default&nbsp;=&nbsp;none</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>SRV_DEBUG_PRINTOUT</tt></td>
<td>switch to print debugging/trace output, default&nbsp;=&nbsp;NO<br>Activate printing with YES, 1, or TRUE.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>NI_SERVICE_NAME_&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;</tt></td>
<td>reassignment of the service name, e.g.:<br>
    <tt>NI_SERVICE_NAME_ID1&nbsp;ID1Prod</tt><br>

<u>Note</u>: Service <tt><i>name</i></tt> must be all capitalized for this setting to work,
e.g. "Entrez" becomes <tt>ENTREZ</tt>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Atlernate service name can also be specified via the registry file by defining they key
<tt>SERVICE_NAME</tt> with desired value, which should be located in the section having the
service name in all capitals. The following registry fragment changes the name of the
<tt>Entrez</tt> service:
<pre>
[ENTREZ]
SERVICE_NAME=EntrezTest
</pre>

<p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="NewDispatcher">Parameters of the NEW dispatcher</a></h2>

For the sake of backward compatibility, all the above (<tt>SRV_...</tt>) parameters are accepted.
They could be either in the environment or in the registry file, section <tt>[NET_SERV]</tt>.

<p>
The following additional parameters are also recognized (and are the preferred way to
tune up the new dispatcher). These parameters can be specified in the environment as
printed in the table, or they can be read from the registry file's section <tt>[CONN]</tt>,
but then without the prefix <tt>CONN</tt>. For example, the environment setting <tt>CONN_FIREWALL=TRUE</tt>
is equivalent to the following registry file fragment:
<pre>
[CONN]
FIREWALL=TRUE
</pre>

<p>
There are also per-service settings, taking the form <tt>&lt;<i>NAME</i>&gt;_CONN_&lt;<i>PARAMETER</i>&gt;</tt>
in the environment, or just like printed below if found in the section <tt>[&lt;<i>NAME</i>&gt;]</tt>
in the registry file. For example, the following settings of <tt>FIREWALL</tt> in the
environment and the registry file are equivalent, and affect <tt>Bounce</tt> service only (leaving
all other services with default or their individual settings, if any):
<ul>
environment:
<pre>
BOUNCE_CONN_FIREWALL=TRUE
</pre>
</ul>
<ul>
registry file:
<pre>
[BOUNCE]
CONN_FIREWALL=TRUE
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
The order of significance (from the most to the least) of specifications is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Per-service environment variable, e.g. <tt>BOUNCE_CONN_FILREWALL=TRUE</tt>;
<li>Per-service registry key, e.g. <tt>CONN_FIREWALL=TRUE</tt> in the section <tt>[BOUNCE]</tt>;
<li>Common environment setting, e.g. <tt>CONN_FIREWALL=TRUE</tt>;
<li>Common registry key from section <tt>[CONN]</tt>, e.g. <tt>FIREWALL=TRUE</tt>;
<li>Default setting.
</ol>

<tr>
<td><tt>CONN_STATELESS</tt></td>
<td><tt>TRUE</tt> or <tt>FALSE</tt>, default&nbsp;=&nbsp;<tt>FALSE</tt>.<br>
A proper value has to be set depending on the nature of the client
(Web-browsers are <tt>CONN_STATELESS=TRUE</tt>).<br>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>CONN_FIREWALL</tt></td>
<td><tt>TRUE</tt> or <tt>FALSE</tt>, default&nbsp;=&nbsp;<tt>FALSE</tt>.<br>
A proper value has to be chosen depending on whether the client is behind a firewall or not.
Use <tt>TRUE</tt> if so!<br> This parameter of the new dispatcher is analogous to switching
the old dispatcher into firewall  mode by specifying <tt>FIREWALL</tt> in <tt>SRV_CONN_MODE</tt>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>CONN_SERVICE_NAME_&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;</tt></td>
<td>see description for <tt>NI_SERVICE_NAME_...</tt> above.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
When intermixed with older (<tt>SRV_...</tt>) parameters, the order of consideration is the following:
the new parameters (<tt>CONN_...</tt>) first as described in the table above, then <tt>SRV_...</tt>
parameters, thus all <tt>SRV_...</tt> parameters taking precedence over all <tt>CONN_...</tt> parameters.
The only exception is the service name override (<tt>{CONN|NI}_SERVICE_NAME_...</tt>), which works the different way:
<ul>
<li>All other parameters loaded, first <tt>CONN_...</tt> using the original service name as specified in the application
(e.g. <tt>Entrez</tt>) from the registry/environment, followed by <tt>SRV_...</tt> found in the registry/environment.
<li><tt>SERVICE_NAME</tt> registry key in the service's section followed by <tt>NI_SERVICE_NAME_...</tt> environment 
variable (if exist) are then consulted for an alternate name.
<li><tt>CONN_SERVICE_NAME_...</tt> environment variable (or service's registry section with <tt>SERVICE_NAME</tt> key)
in then consulted, using a new name from the substitution above (if occurred). This process is recursive but with
no loop detection, i.e. CONN_SERVICE_NAME_A=B and CONN_SERVICE_NAME_B=A would create an infinite loop, which
breaks the application. The following registry/environment combination changes the name of the <tt>Entrez</tt>
service into <tt>Entrez2</tt>:
<p>
environment:
<pre>
NI_SERVICE_NAME_ENTREZ=EntrezTest
</pre>
<p>
registry:
<pre>
[ENTREZ]
SERVICE_NAME=Entrez1 ; Note that this key is overriden in the env

[ENTREZ_TEST]
SERVICE_NAME=Entrez2
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
<u>Note</u> that if a client connects to new NCBI dispatcher, then
the dispatcher might be able to switch the client into pseudo-firewall
mode, should the dispatcher notice that this might be needed for the
client to further succeed with the service requested. This however
is <i>not</i> a substitute for <tt>CONN_FIREWALL</tt> parameter, and an application,
which connects from behind a firewall, must still use <tt>CONN_FIREWALL=TRUE</tt>
in order to function flawlessly.

<p>
Also note that C toolkit can have debugging printouts disabled in the core,
thus <tt>{SRV|CONN}_DEBUG_PRINTOUT</tt> will have no or very little effect.
In order to override the core settings, <i>environment</i> setting
<tt>DEBUG_PRINTOUT=TRUE</tt> could be used. Unlike <tt>{SRV|CONN}_DEBUG_PRINTOUT</tt>
the last key has no effect outside the environment (and thus specifying <tt>DEBUG_PRINTOUT</tt>
in the registry file will not affect in-core logging settings). This override option
was recently added to the toolkit, and applications built before mid August 2002 lack this feature.

<p>
For applications linked against C++ toolkit, <i>environment</i> settings
<tt>DIAG_POST_LEVEL=0</tt> and <tt>DIAG_TRACE=1</tt> would enable the debugging printouts
regardless of the in-core settings. You may also use these keys in the <tt>[DEBUG]</tt>
section of the registry file (but <i>not</i> in the <tt>[NET_SERV]</tt> or
<tt>[CONN]</tt> sections).

<h1><a name="Firewalling">Taking care of firewall connections</a></h1>

<p>
If you are behind a firewall, it must be configured correctly to access NCBI
services. Your network administrators may have done this already. If not, please
have them read the section below.

<p>
<b>The following section is intended for network administrators:</b>

<p>
Using NCBI services from behind a security firewall requires opening ports in
your firewall. The ports to open are:

<p align="center">
<pre>
Firewall Port        IP Address
--------------------------------
 5860..5870         130.14.29.112
    5845            130.14.22.12  (no access from outside NCBI!)
</pre>

<p>
If your firewall is not transparent, the firewall port number
should be mapped to the same port number on the external host.

<p>
While the not every port from the table above might be currently in use,
we stongly recommend you to have them all configured on your firewall.

<p>
<u>TROUBLESHOOTING</u>:  You can test whether these ports are accessible from
your host by just running, for example (see the "Ports to open" list above):
<pre>
  telnet 130.14.29.112 5861
</pre>
and entering a line of arbitrary text in the telnet session.
If everything is fine, your TELNET session would look as follows
(the line "test" is your input there):

<pre>
| > telnet 130.14.29.112 5861
| Trying 130.14.29.112...
| Connected to 130.14.29.112.
| Escape character is '^]'.
| test
| NCBI Firewall Daemon:  Invalid ticket. Connection closed.
| Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>

<p>
There is also an auxiliary UNIX shell script
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/NETWORK/fwd_check.sh">fwd_check.sh</a> to check all of the above
addresses.

<p>
To check the ports as they are seen from within NCBI you can use
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/NETWORK/fwd_check.cgi">this test page</a>,
which shows you whether the ports are open and the firewall daemon is
listening on them. The page does not however provide you with the information
whether these ports are accessible from your site. You still have to use
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/NETWORK/fwd_check.sh">fwd_check.sh</a>
to check that.

<h1><a name="WorkAround">Working around connectivity problems</a></h1>

<p>
Executable <tt>Psrventr.REAL</tt>, which implements old <tt><b>Entrez</b></tt> service
on Solaris sparc, was confirmed flaky, and had to be removed from configurations of both new and old
dispatchers on the sparcs.

<p>
Although this should not affect the users of the new dispatcher (as the
service had been moved to and is currently provided from a number of Intel machines),
the users of the old dispatcher (which was not ported to <tt>Linux/Intel</tt> platform, and
overall is considered for phasing out as inflexible and outdated) may be affected.

<p>
The workaround is to use the code in the toolkit that has been around long
ago but was not made active until mid August 2002 - we then switched the toolkit
to use the new dispatcher code by default.

<p>
For that, the user has to define <tt>SRV_CONN_MODE=SERVICE</tt> either in the environment,
or in the configuration (<tt>.ini</tt>) file, section <tt>[NET_SERV]</tt>, and can do so <i>without</i> an
absolute necessity of downloading the new toolkit code from NCBI and rebuilding. Only very-very old
applications will not be able to use the switch, and have to be upgraded by linking against freshened libraries.

<p>
If an application runs from behind a firewall, then <tt>CONN_FIREWALL=TRUE</tt> should also be set in the environment
(in addition to <tt>SRV_CONN_MODE=SERVICE</tt>). Please note that <tt>CONN_FIREWALL</tt>
<i>must</i> remain set even if you switch into the newer toolkit release, which does not require setting
<tt>SRV_CONN_MODE</tt> for the use of the new dispatcher.

<p>
<b>The overall rule</b> in the case when your application fails to connect to an NCBI service is to
undertake the following sequence of steps:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Try to force your application to use the new dispatcher code by setting <tt><b>SRV_CONN_MODE</b></tt>
to <tt><b>SERVICE</b></tt> in the environment/registry;
<li>If this does not help, or if you are connecting from behind a firewall, try to set
<tt><b>CONN_FIREWALL</b></tt> to <tt><b>TRUE</b></tt> in addition to the above setting,
and run your application again;
<li>If you are still unable to connect, set <tt><b>SRV_DEBUG_PRINTOUT</b></tt> to <tt><b>TRUE</b></tt>,
and collect the output. (You may also need to set <i>environment</i> variable <tt><b>DEBUG_PRINTOUT</b></tt> to
<tt><b>TRUE</b></tt> in addition, if the in-core settings prevent debugging output from being released onto
the terminal. Please note that unlike other <tt><b>{CONN|SRV}...</b></tt> keys described in this document,
<tt><b>DEBUG_PRINTOUT</b></tt> is honored only if set in the environment and has <i>no</i> effect if
put in the registry file.) Beware that debugging output may be copious.
<ul>
<li>If with all the above settings you can find references to either <tt><b>Service/nph-dispd.cgi</b></tt>
or <tt><b>Service/nph-ncbid.cgi</b></tt> in the collected output, it means that your application was linked
against very old version of the toolkit and has to be rebuilt;
<li>If you cannot find references to either of these CGIs, then you can consider contacting
<a href="mailto:info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">NCBI Help Desk</a> to resolve your problem.
</ul>
</ol>

<p>
Small reference on how to set the environment in various shells
(to know the shell in UNIX/Linux, execute "<tt>echo&nbsp;$SHELL</tt>"):
<ul>
<li>C-like shells: <tt>csh</tt> or <tt>tcsh</tt>
<pre>
    setenv SRV_DEBUG_PRINTOUT TRUE
</pre>
<li>Born-like shells: <tt>sh</tt>, <tt>ash</tt>, <tt>ksh</tt>, <tt>zsh</tt>,
or <tt>bash</tt>
<pre>
    SRV_DEBUG_PRINTOUT=TRUE; export SRV_DEBUG_PRINOUT
</pre>
In <tt>ksh</tt>, <tt>zsh</tt>, and <tt>bash</tt> the two commands above can be combined:
<pre>
    export SRV_DEBUG_PRINTOUT=TRUE
</pre>
<li>DOS shell (MS-Windows/DOS): <tt>command.com</tt> or <tt>cmd.exe</tt>
<pre>
    set SRV_DEBUG_PRINTOUT=TRUE
</pre>
</ul>
