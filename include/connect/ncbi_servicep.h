 * CAUTION: unlike 'service' parameter, 'arg' and 'val' are not copied from,
 *          but the original pointers to them get stored -- take this into
 *          account while dealing with dynamically allocated strings in the
 *          slow iterative version of the call below -- the pointers must
 *          remain valid as long as the iterator stays open (i.e. until
 *          SERV_Close() gets called).
 *
 * NOTE: Preference 0.0 does not prohibit the preferred_host to be selected;
 *       nor preference 100.0 ultimately opts for the preferred_host; rather,
 *       the preference is considered as an estimate for the selection
 *       probability when all other conditions for favoring the host are
 *       optimal, i.e. preference 0.0 actually means not to favor the preferred
 *       host at all, while 100.0 means to opt for that as much as possible.
 * NOTE: Preference < 0 is a special value that means to latch the preferred
 *       host[:port] if the service exists out there, regardless of the load
 *       (but taking into account the server disposition [working/non-working]
 *       only -- servers, which are down, don't get returned).
