 * File Description:
 *   Generic API to open and handle connection to an abstract I/O service.
 *   Several methods can be used to establish the connection, and each of them
 *   yields in a simple handle(of type "CONN") that contains a handle(of type
 *   "CONNECTOR") to a data and methods implementing the generic connection I/O
 *   operations. E.g. this API can be used to:
 *     1) connect using HTTPD-based dispatcher (e.g. to NCBI services);
 *     2) hit a CGI script;
 *     3) connect to a bare socket at some "host:port";
 *     4) whatever else can fit this paradigm -- see the SConnectorTag-related
 *        structures;  e.g. it could be a plain file I/O or even a memory area.
 *
 *  See in "ncbi_connector.h" for the detailed specification of the underlying
 *  connector("CONNECTOR", "SConnectorTag") methods and data structures.
