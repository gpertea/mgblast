Directions for building the NCBI toolkit on Macintosh computers

1)  Increase the Preferred Size of the Script Editor to 7000 K using the
    Finder.  Script Editor is the program that runs the AppleScript make*.met
    files used to build the NCBI libraries and applications.
2)  Take the sources of NCBI tookit at
      ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ncbi_tools/ncbi.hqx
3)  Un-BinHex ncbi.hqx into ncbi.sea, and double click on the ncbi.sea file
    to extract the ncbi folder.  Your own file transfer program may do these
    steps automatically.
4)  Double click on the demo.sea within the ncbi folder to extract the demo
    folder.  This is necessary because without it the number of files in the
    toolkit exceeds the file limit of the archiver program.
5)  Drag the resulting ncbi folder inside the Metrowerks CodeWarrior 7.0
    folder.  The make files expect this configuration, and will not work if
    the ncbi folder is put anywhere else.
6)  Inside the ncbi:make subfolder are two files with .met extensions.
    Double click on CodeWarrior IDE 4.2.5, then run makeall.met.  The libraries
    are built in the ncbi:lib folder.
    You may need to restart CodeWarrior before running the make script.
7)  After the libraries are built, run makedemo.met.  This builds application
    programs such as Entrez, Sequin, and tbl2asn.
8)  In order to run on MacOS versions earlier than 8.5, open the PowerPC
    projects, click on AppearanceLib, choose Window->Project Inspector, check
    Import Weak, and click the Save button.  Do the same for NavigationLib.
