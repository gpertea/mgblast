*
* File Description:
*    This is a companion file to sequinx.c. In order to register additional proceedures
*    of your own design, to replace or supplement those intrinsic to sequin,
*    we have provided sequinx.c where you can register your functions with the
*    object manager. For demonstration purposes, we have included a REGISTER call
*    (commented out) to functions in this file.
*
*    This file contains the demonstration functions themselves, as well as extensive
*    comments describing what they do. They are intended to serve as a model for what
*    you might do in a file of your own design.
*
*    Basically, to register a proceedure with the object manager, you call a function
*    which specifies a name for the function, a string to show in a menu, an input
*    data type (OBJ_ in objmgr.h), possibly a subtype, and an output type, and possibly
*    a subtype, the type of function (filter, editor, etc), and a pointer to the function
*    to be called. The called function always
*    returns an Int2 (whose values are defined in objmgr.h as OM_MSG_RET_...) and takes
*    a single Pointer as an argument. This pointer always must be cast to an OMProcControlPtr
*    (objmgr.h) which contains the input arguments. It is only declared as a Pointer because
*    of C typedef order limitations. We will call this function the "work" function.
*
*    The work function does the real job. It looks at the contents of the data pointer,
*    executes the appropriate actions and returns a completion or error code. Normally it
*    will return one of:
*      OM_MSG_RET_ERROR - an error occurred, presumably reported with ErrPostEx()
*      OM_MSG_RET_OK - everything was ok, but this function did not do anything.
*      OM_MSG_RET_DONE - everything was ok, and this function did the processing requested.
*
*    When the object manager looks for a function to satisfy a request it enters a loop
*    which goes through appropriate functions until the action is done. First, it goes
*    through all registered functions of the requested class (editor, filter,..) in priority
*    order. First it looks for a match of type, and subtype. Failing that, it looks for a
*    match to type, with subtype = 0 (any). For each match, it calls the function with the
*    data. If the functions returns OM_MSG_RET_ERROR, or OM_MSG_RET_OK, the object manager
*    tries the next function. When a function returns OM_MSG_RET_DONE or there are no more
*    matching functions, the object manager returns. This means your functions can be called
*    before or after the default functions (priority), or by specifying a subtype not
*    supported by a default function. You can have your function called first, check the
*    data to decide if you want to handle it, return OM_MSG_RET_DONE if you do, or 
*    OM_MSG_RET_OK if you want the object manager to find some other function to handle it.
*
*    If you wish your function to receive messages from the object manager you must also
*    supply a message loop function and register it with the object manager when your
*    function is first called. You must remember to unregister it when your function exits.
*    If your function performs some quick computation and returns, you probably don't need
*    a message loop function. If it will persist awhile (like an editor or viewer) you
*    probably will. This is for cases such as 1) your function is a viewer showing Bioseq X
*    2) some other function is an editor on Bioseq X. When Bioseq X is updated in the editor
*    it will send an update message to the object manager. Your function will want to receive
*    this message so it can update its display from the underlying (now edited) data
*    appropriately. Your message loop should return OM_MSG_RET_OK (not _DONE) so the object
*    manager will continue to relay the message to all functions that want to see it.
