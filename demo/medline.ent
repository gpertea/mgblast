abstract "Multiple heat shock cognate (hsc70) cDNA clones were isolated from t
he mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line F9. They all encode a single 72-kDa pro
tein, which is constitutively expressed in all mouse cell lines and tissues te
sted, and which is only slightly induced by hyperthermia. hsc70 RNA is very ab
undant in F9 stem cells and brain, but very little is found in 14-day-old embr
yos. Upon differentiation of F9 stem cells induced by retinoic acid and cyclic
 AMP, expression of the hsc70 gene decreases only slightly, suggesting that hs
c70 is highly expressed in early mouse development and is then down-regulated 
towards the end of embryogenesis. In adult tissues only the brain retains the 
high level of hsc70 gene expression found in F9 stem cells. We also show that 
expression of hsc70 protein and clathrin is uncoupled in F9 cells, indicating 
that the uncoating activity of coated vesicles may not be the only function of
 hsc70 protein.",
