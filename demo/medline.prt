abstract "Multiple heat shock cognate (hsc70) cDNA clones were isolated from t
he mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line F9. They all encode a single 72-kDa pro
tein, which is constitutively expressed in all mouse cell lines and tissues te
sted, and which is only slightly induced by hyperthermia. hsc70 RNA is very ab
undant in F9 stem cells and brain, but very little is found in 14-day-old embr
yos. Upon differentiation of F9 stem cells induced by retinoic acid and cyclic
 AMP, expression of the hsc70 gene decreases only slightly, suggesting that hs
c70 is highly expressed in early mouse development and is then down-regulated 
towards the end of embryogenesis. In adult tissues only the brain retains the 
high level of hsc70 gene expression found in F9 stem cells. We also show that 
expression of hsc70 protein and clathrin is uncoupled in F9 cells, indicating 
that the uncoating activity of coated vesicles may not be the only function of
 hsc70 protein.",

abstract "During development, the alcohol dehydrogenase genes of Drosophila me
lanogaster and D. affinidisjuncta are expressed in similar, yet distinct, tiss
ue- and stage-specific patterns. Transcripts from both of these genes arise fr
om two promoters (distal and proximal) that also display tissue and stage spec
ificity. We used P-element-mediated transformation to introduce the D. affinid
isjuncta Adh gene into the germ line of D. melanogaster. We show that the D. a
ffinidisjuncta Adh gene is expressed at comparable overall levels in both spec
ies and that the tissue- and stage-specific expression for this gene (includin
g promoter utilization) is similar in the donor and the host species. However,
 in some details, the expression of the D. affinidisjuncta gene in D. melanoga
ster resembles the host pattern, and one novel tissue-specific expression phen
otype is displayed by transformants. In general, our results suggest that ther

abstract "The commitment of cells to specific fates, as well as the transition
s in the cell cycle and transcription that occur at the cellular blastoderm st
age of Drosophila embryogenesis, suggest that there are genes with unique func
tions expressed specifically at this stage. In an attempt to identify such gen
es, we used molecular screening to isolate several loci which encode blastoder
m-specific transcripts (Roark et al., (1985). Dev. Biol. 109, 476-488). We rep
ort here the complete nucleotide sequence of one of these genes, terminus (ter
), which maps to 75C1,2. The predicted ter protein possesses a transcription f
actor IIIA (TFIIIA)-like putative Zn-binding, DNA-binding finger. The ter RNA,
 detected by in situ hybridization, is distributed uniformly in the embryo dur
ing the syncytial blastoderm stage, and then becomes more concentrated in the 
posterior during the late cellular blastoderm stage. During gastrulation, the 
RNA is most concentrated in the amnioproctodeal invagination; it is also found
 at a lower concentration in the ventral furrow and in the anterodorsal neurog
enic region. By the end of germ band extension, ter RNA is no longer detected.

abstract "We used the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene

emia virus (EIAV) genome. The EIAV long terminal repeat (LTR) directed CAT act
ivity in a canine cell line, but at levels much lower than those achieved with
 other eucaryotic viral promoters. In the same cells infected with EIAV or cot
ransfected with molecularly cloned EIAV genomic DNA, LTR-directed activity was
 markedly enhanced. Comparison of cat mRNA and protein levels in these cells i
ndicated that this trans-activating effect could be accounted for by a bimodal
 mechanism in which both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events are en
hanced. trans-Activation but not promoter activity was abolished by deletion o
f the R-U5 region of the EIAV LTR. EIAV sequences responsible for the trans-ac
tivating function could be localized to a region encompassing the 3' and 5' te

 intermediate subviral particles but not from cores, suggesting that the fiber

abstract "Promoter elements responsible for directing the transcription of six
 tightly clustered vaccinia virus (VV) late genes (open reading frames [ORFs] 
D11, D12, D13, A1, A2, and A3) from the HindIII D/A region of the viral genome
 were identified within the upstream sequences proximal to each individual loc
us. These regions were identified as promoters by excising them from the VV ge
nome, abutting them to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene, 
and demonstrating their ability to drive expression of the reporter gene in tr
ansient-expression assays in an orientation-specific manner. To delineate the 
5' boundary of the upstream elements, two of the VV late gene (A1 and D13) pro
moter: CAT constructs were subjected to deletion mutagenesis procedures. A ser
ies of 5' deletions of the ORF A1 promoter from -114 to -24 showed no reductio
n in promoter activity, whereas additional deletion of the sequences from -24 
to +2 resulted in the complete loss of activity. Deletion of the ORF A1 fragme
nt from -114 to -104 resulted in a 24% increase in activity, suggesting the pr
esence of a negative regulatory region. In marked contrast to previous 5' dele
tion analyses which have identified VV late promoters as 20- to 30-base-pair c
ap-proximal sequences, 5' deletions to define the upstream boundary of the ORF
 D13 promoter identified two positive regulatory regions, the first between -2
35 and -170 and the second between -123 and -106. Background levels of chloram
phenicol acetyltransferase expression were obtained with deletions past -88. S
ignificantly, this places the ORF D13 regulatory regions within the upstream c
oding sequences of the ORF A1. A high-stringency computer search for homologie
s between VV late promoters that have been thus far characterized was carried 
out. Several potential consensus sequences were found just upstream from RNA s
tart sites of temporally related promoter elements. Three major conclusions ar
e drawn from these experiments. (i) The presence of promoters preceding each l
ate ORF supports the hypothesis that each is expressed as an individual transc
riptional unit. (ii) Promoter elements can be located within the coding portio
n of the upstream gene. (iii) Sequence homologies between temporally related p
romoter elements support the notion of kinetic subclasses of late genes.",

nfected-cell proteins of 84, 50, 43, and 34 kilodaltons. These proteins were p
hosphorylated and were associated predominantly with the nuclei of infected ce
lls. The 43-kilodalton protein was the most abundant of the four proteins, and
 its level of expression remained relatively constant throughout the infection
. Expression of the other proteins increased as the infection progressed. Puls
e-chase analysis failed to show a precursor-product relationship between any o
f the proteins. A comparison of the [35S]methionine-labeled tryptic peptide ma
ps of the four proteins from infected cells and an in vitro-generated polypept
ide derived from the putative first exon showed that all four infected-cell pr
oteins were of viral origin and contained a common amino-terminal region.",

abstract "Genetic analysis of the transcriptional control sequences of the E1b
 gene of adenovirus type 5 identified two regions that stimulated specific tra
nscription by whole cell extracts from uninfected cells. The first region, loc
ated within 50 nucleotides (position -50) 5' to the transcription initiation (
cap) site, contains a G+C-rich consensus-binding site (GC box) for the transcr
iption factor Sp1 and a TATA box. Unambiguous stimulatory activity of the seco
nd region, between positions -358 and -127, was observed only in the absence o
f the GC box. DNase I protection experiments (footprinting) with crude nuclear
 extracts from uninfected cells revealed multiple DNA-protein interactions at 
the control region. Proximal to the initiation site, both the GC box and the c
ap site were protected; however, protection of the TATA box was not observed. 
In the distal region, four protein-binding sites, designated I through IV, wer
e located between positions -250 and -120. Three of the four mapped in protein
-coding sequences of the adjacent E1a gene. Sites I and II were 5' to position
 -218 whereas sites III and IV were 3' to position -218. This finding was cons
istent with results of the transcriptional analysis indicating that subsets of
 the distal region were sufficient for stimulation of transcription in vitro i
n the absence of the GC box. Within the boundaries of site I, a 10-base-pair p
rotected sequence was similar to one located 5' to the adenovirus E1a, E2a, E3
, E4, E2 late, and polypeptide IX transcription initiation sites. Sequences wi
thin the boundaries of the other three sites were similar to those within othe

avian sarcoma and leukosis retroviruses. Subgroup D viruses are closely relate
d to the subgroup B viruses but have an extended host range that includes the 
ability to penetrate certain mammalian cells. There are 27 amino acid differen
ces shared between the subgroup D sequence and three subgroup B sequences. At 
16 of these sites, the subgroup D sequence is identical to the sequence of one
 or more of the other subgroup viruses (A, C, and E). The remaining 11 sites a
re specific to subgroup D and show some clustering in the two large variable r
egions that are thought to be major determinants of host range. Biological ana
lysis of recombinant viruses containing a dominant selectable marker confirmed
 the role of the gp85-coding domain in determining the host range of the subgr
oup D virus in the infection of mammalian cells. We also compared the sequence
 of the gp85-coding domain from two subgroup A viruses, Rous-associated virus 
type 1 and a subgroup A virus of the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma vir

result in changes in potential glycosylation sites. The positions of 10 amino 
acid differences are coincident with the positions of 10 differences found bet
ween two subgroup B virus env gene sequences. These 10 sites identify seven do
mains in the sequence which may constitute determinants of type-specific antig
