* $Log: blast_input.h,v $
* Revision 1.18  2006/04/21 14:33:44  madden
* BLAST_GetQuerySeqLoc parameter ctr is now a pointer to Int4, fixes case of more than 32k queries
*
* Revision 1.17  2005/08/08 15:51:41  dondosha
* Added genetic code argument to BLAST_GetQuerySeqLoc, to save in the created Bioseqs
*
* Revision 1.16  2005/04/06 23:27:53  dondosha
* Doxygen fixes
*
* Revision 1.15  2005/02/09 20:55:38  dondosha
* Changed doxygen group from AlgoBlast, which is reserved for C++ toolkit, to CToolkitAlgoBlast
*
* Revision 1.14  2005/02/02 18:57:21  dondosha
* Pass back lower case mask in a SeqLoc form; removed unused function
